"""Detect 2-argument `expect-failure` forms in Pact .repl files.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`(expect-failure "doc" (expr))` matches **any** failure, so it cannot distinguish
"the module refused this correctly" from "the test was malformed". In this repo that
is not theoretical:

 * `SPT-init.repl:42` started passing on an ARITY error when `init`
 gained a parameter, and asserted nothing for its whole life (a later change).
 * `SPT.repl:21` never entered `init-supply` at all — its arguments
 aborted first — and passed (a later change).
 * a later change converted 82 such forms. One had been added to `a probe kept out of this repo`
 AFTER the defect was formally recorded, because nothing could detect it.

The static gate (`pact-static-check.sh`) catches only the two EMPTY-STRING cases
(`expect-failure ""` and `expect-failure "doc" ""`). Neither catches the arity case,
which needs paren- and string-aware argument counting. A regex cannot do that: forms
span lines, code arguments contain `)` inside strings and `;` comments, and
`expect-failure` appears inside comments and string literals that must NOT count.

NON-VACUITY IS ENFORCED, NOT DOCUMENTED
---------------------------------------
The self-test runs on EVERY invocation, before any file is scanned. If the scanner
cannot find the positives in its own fixture, it exits non-zero and reports nothing
clean. "A check that inspected zero items must FAIL, never PASS."

SCOPE, AND WHY IT IS NOT EVERYTHING (a later change §4)
------------------------------------------------
Default scope is `pact/test/` — the gate. TWO 2-arg forms live outside it and are
DELIBERATELY not converted, because they are EVIDENCE RECORDS rather than tests:

 * `an internal document{compose,contrast}.repl` (2) — an
 EXTERNAL reviewer's scratch files.

Rewriting them would misrepresent what was actually run to reach a published
conclusion. They are run by nothing, so they cannot produce a false green. Pass an
explicit glob to scan them anyway.

WAS EIGHT, MEASURED AS TWO (a later change). The other six were in `pact/spike/` —
test-voting-nolock.repl (5) and test-award-distribution.repl (1) — and went with the
spike directory when the repo narrowed to SPT + launch. Note the older phrasing here and in
the project notes read "the 8 forms in pact/spike and the pco working files", which parses as
8 + 2; the true split was always 6 + 2. Numbers about a set belong next to a command
that produces them: python3 .github/scripts/expect-failure-arity.py &lt;paths&gt;

EXIT CODES
----------
 0 self-test passed, every file parsed, zero 2-arg forms found
 1 2-arg forms found (they are listed)
 2 TOOLING FAILURE — self-test failed, no files matched, or a file was skipped.
 Never confuse this with 0. A skipped file is not a clean file.
