 # Includes MISSING-DEPENDENCY errors, but ONLY for known pre-deployed upstream
 # modules (coin, ns, fungible-*, marmalade, kip.*, util.*). A module that calls
 # e.g. `coin` fails a bare load because the standalone CLI has only a stub of it
 # ("Module coin has no such member: get-balance") or none at all ("Cannot find
 # module: coin"). That is an environment gap, not a code defect — the .repl
 # harness loads the real dependency and passes.
 #
